# MCU Manager (Web Bluetooth)

This tool is the Web Bluetooth version of MCU Manager that enables a user to communicate with and manage remote devices running the Mynewt OS. It uses a connection profile to establish a connection with a device and sends command requests to the device.

The main focus is implementing firmware updates via Web Bluetooth, however other commands might be supported as well.
